# Works on Arm miniNodes Edge

Arm and miniNodes have partnered to make Arm-based edge devices and single board computers available for open source software developers to build, test and optimize for Arm. Developers can request hardware for any number of use-cases including, but not limited to:

- Porting, testing, and optimizing for Arm 
- Building new projects on Arm-based edge hardware
- Getting more visibility for your project through the Works on Arm program

The [Works on Arm program]( https://www.worksonarm.com/) provides free access to common Arm-based edge hardware, early-access hardware from Arm partners, and computing resources for open source developers. The on-demand resources are managed by [miniNodes]( https://www.mininodes.com/) as part of its commitment to the Arm communities. Funding for the system is provided by Arm Inc.

**Available hardware:**
- Jetson Nano 4gb
- Jetson Nano 2gb
